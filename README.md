# Simulated-Temperature-Sensor-with-ESP32-and-Web-Server
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 to simulate a temperature sensor and serve the data through a simple web server. The ESP32 connects to a WiFi network and hosts a local web server that displays the simulated temperature on a web page. The temperature is generated randomly between 20.0°C and 30.0°C.
